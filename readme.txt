WordPress Plugin that provides data-at-rest encryption of post content

== Description ==

Encrypts selected WordPress posts prior to writing to the database. Provides an additional layer of security for storing sensitive information in shared hosting and other at-risk environments.

Uses 256-bit AES encryption. [More information on encryption used](http://www.itnewb.com/tutorial/PHP-Encryption-Decryption-Using-the-MCrypt-Library-libmcrypt)

While theoretically **more** secure than storing posts in plain text, this plugin is not a replacement for traditional secure data storage. Use at your own risk. Provided as is.
